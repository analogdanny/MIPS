# MIPS

Designed, simulated, and implemented a simple 32-bit microprocessor with an instruction set that was similar to the MIPS instruction set. 
This was created using VHDL and simulated in ModelSim using testbenches. Once testbenches were successfully operational, the architecture was
uploaded onto the DE10-lite Board to test real-time functionality.
